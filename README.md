# FileRead Web Application
FileRead is a web application built with Go (Golang) using the Gin web framework. It provides functionalities to serve files, display a welcome message. This README provides an overview of the project structure and instructions for setup and usage.


## Installtion


1. Run the following command to start the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up
```


2. Running Directly with Go
If you prefer to run the application directly with Go, follow these steps:

    1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Go website: Install Go

    2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.

    3. Run the following command to start the application:

    ```bash 
    go run main.go
    ```

    4. Your application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080


### File Streaming Optimization

#### Purpose:
The optimization aims to enhance the efficiency and simplicity of streaming entire files in a web application developed using the Gin web framework in Go.

#### Method:
Utilizes the `ctx.File(filePath)` method provided by the Gin framework, which internally leverages the `http.ServeFile` function from the Go standard library.

#### Why Use This Optimization:
1. **Efficiency**: The `http.ServeFile` function efficiently serves file contents to clients by utilizing system-level optimizations, reducing resource usage and improving performance.
2. **Simplicity**: By using `ctx.File(filePath)`, developers can achieve file streaming with minimal code, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
3. **Security**: The implementation provided by `http.ServeFile` handles various security considerations, such as preventing directory traversal attacks, ensuring safe file serving.
4. **Consistency**: Using standard library functions promotes consistency across different parts of the codebase and aligns with best practices recommended by the Go community.
5. **Robustness**: Leveraging well-tested standard library functionality reduces the likelihood of bugs and enhances the reliability of the application.

#### Conclusion:
By employing the `ctx.File(filePath)` method, the optimization simplifies the code while ensuring efficient and secure file streaming, contributing to a more robust and maintainable web application.
